  "Use Knitting when CPU-heavy, bursty, or isolation-sensitive work should leave the main thread without becoming a separate service. Its compact API combines typed calls with shared-memory IPC, work stealing, timeouts, cancellation, worker permissions, and zero-copy paths for large binary payloads. Knitting treats CPU spent waiting, polling, copying, and coordinating as overhead to minimize: idle workers park instead of spinning, and on supported runtimes the host waits on a doorbell instead of polling. The goal is performance isolation without spending the capacity that isolation is meant to recover.",
  "",
  "The measured result behind that goal is CPU parity at matched load, not parallelism at any cost. In the published Hono fixed-rate run, the inline server used 1.08 server-process cores and the one-worker server used 1.10 while both completed about 6,000 RPS; an equivalent repeat of the one-worker configuration recorded 1.06 cores. Read that as approximately 1.1 cores for both shapes. At the same time, `/ping`—which never entered the pool—improved from 16.93ms to 2.31ms p99 because it no longer waited behind SSR and JWT. This is a workload-specific result from 15-second runs, not a universal performance guarantee; see the [Hono benchmark](/documents/hono-16core-benchmark.md) for methodology and limitations.",

export const ESSENTIALS = [
  "## Essentials for writing working code",
  "",
  "### Install and task contract",
  "",
  "- Install: `npm install knitting` (the npm package is `knitting`; it is also on JSR as `@vixeny/knitting`). These docs cover 0.1.76. Use Node 22+, Deno 2+, or Bun 1+. For Andromeda, follow the experimental setup below.",
  "- A task is an exported function at module scope. Wrap it with `task({ f })` only when you want options like a timeout or an abort signal.",
  "- Tasks take ONE argument. Use a tuple or object for multiple values: `([a, b]) => a + b`.",
  "- Guard host-only code with `isMain` — workers re-import the module.",
  "- Module loading: each worker re-imports the module that DEFINES your tasks, and its top-level `import`s run in every worker (they are hoisted — `isMain` does NOT gate them). Keep tasks in a lean module separate from your server/framework code. Tasks must be `export`ed or the loader can't find them and the call silently hangs. `importTask` targets must be plain functions, not `task()` wrappers.",
  "- Create a pool with `createPool(options)({ taskA, taskB })`, then call `await pool.call.taskA(args)`.",
  "",
  "### Scheduling and lifetime",
  "- Scheduling: compatible pools with more than one worker use work stealing by default, except on Andromeda. Workers take waiting tasks from a shared submit region and return results through their own lanes. The options are `host.steal`, `host.stealRegionLanes`, `host.stealClaim`, and `host.doorbell`. `stealClaim` defaults to `ticket`; you can also choose `dekker`. `KNITTING_STEAL_CLAIM` accepts the same values, but setting the host option overrides it. Unknown values, including the old `cas-mask` option, cause pool creation to throw.",
  "- Ticket queue failures: a fatal decoder or worker failure closes the shared queue. Calls still waiting for results and any new calls then reject, so shut down and replace the pool. A task that throws or returns a rejected promise only rejects that call.",
  "- Adaptive claims (0.1.74): `host.stealSingleClaimMicroseconds` defaults to 0, which turns adaptation off. Each worker measures average task cost per batch and remembers the highest recent average, letting that estimate fall gradually as more batches run. When it meets or exceeds your threshold, the worker takes one ticket at a time; below it, the worker takes up to `stealRegionLanes`. Try 20 microseconds when you have slow and fast tasks, then check p99 latency and throughput. This only applies to ticket pools with more than one worker. A ticket batch width of 1 skips timing. Negative, NaN, or infinite thresholds cause pool creation to throw when stealing is enabled.",
  "- Await-then-compute tasks (0.1.76): bundlers, minifiers, and other async tasks that await input before doing CPU-heavy work can bunch their continuations on one stealing worker. Try `worker: { maxAwaitingTasks: 2 }` to leave more queued tasks available for peers; synchronous tasks do not use a slot. See the Work stealing guide.",
  "- CPU efficiency is a design goal: useful task work should consume CPU; waiting, polling, unnecessary copying, and oversized pools should not. A single worker spins 50us before parking because it is on the request's critical path; multi-worker pools park immediately, since a peer is already awake to take the work. The host doorbell uses the runtime's completion wake path — Atomics on Node/Bun, FFI on Deno when allowed, and a process-local transport for process workers — with polling fallback. Node threads can opt into `host.nativeDoorbell`. Expect a bigger pool to raise CPU per request without raising throughput when the host is the only producer (a server), so size `threads` from measurements, not from core count — see the Multi-threading guide.",
  "- Cleanup: `using pool = createPool(...)` disposes the pool at scope exit. `await pool.shutdown()` still exists to close it earlier or to await teardown.",
  "- Keep a server pool alive across requests; do not create and dispose workers on every request. Await outstanding calls before leaving a `using` scope. If your runtime or build pipeline does not support `using`, use `try/finally` with `await pool.shutdown()`.",
  "",
  "### Isolation and data ownership",
  '- Isolation: `importTask({ href, name })` keeps a task\'s code off the host (only the worker imports it). Set `worker.runtime: "process"` to run each worker as a separate process — including inside a bwrap sandbox or a container.',
  "- Security: `importTask` prevents the task module from being imported or evaluated at host scope, but it is not a sandbox. For genuinely untrusted code, use process workers with an OS sandbox or container and restrictive permissions; runtime permissions are guardrails, not a complete security boundary.",
  "- Zero-copy IN: `ProcessSharedBuffer` (`knitting/shared-memory`) shares bytes across processes; `SharedArrayBuffer` and `BufferReference` (`knitting/unsafe`) move bytes to thread workers without copying. `createKnittingAllocator()` and the HTTP body helpers choose pooled regions or a moved reference with bounded ownership. Pick by boundary — process vs thread.",
  "- Binary results: return an ordinary top-level `Uint8Array` or `ArrayBuffer`; thread workers use the safe ownership path automatically at 256 KiB and above. Use `unsafe: { SharedBytes: true }` and `sharedBytes()` only for intentionally short-lived borrowed returns. `knitting/utils` converts string/JSON/number ↔ `SharedArrayBuffer`.",
  "- Optimized for HTTP: `call.*()` accepts `Promise<supported>` inputs, so forward `request.arrayBuffer()` (e.g. Hono `c.req.arrayBuffer()`) straight into a task without awaiting it on the request thread — UTF-8 decode / JSON parse then happens in the worker. Ideal for SSR, JWT, and upload routes.",
  "- Treat the boundary as serialization, not shared JavaScript state. Consult Payloads for supported types; do not assume closures, framework request objects, class instances, or arbitrary functions can cross it. A moved buffer and a borrowed/shared buffer have different lifetimes: follow the ownership guide before reusing either.",
  "",
  "### Failures and troubleshooting",
  "- Workers are quiet by default: in strict mode worker `console.*` does NOT reach the host — set `permission: { console: true }` to surface it. Common direct exit calls (`process.exit`, `process.kill`, `process.abort`, and `Deno.exit`) are blocked, but this is not a complete security boundary; resource exhaustion and runtime or native-code vulnerabilities still require OS-level isolation.",
  "- Debugging goes to STDERR: pass `debug: true` to `createPool` (or set the `KNITTING_DEBUG=*` env var) to stream diagnostics, each line tagged with the worker (`host`, `w0`, `w1`, …), the runtime, and a per-worker ms timer. Select namespaces instead of all — `host` (pool/task setup), `imports` (which modules each worker loaded), `lifecycle` (worker ready / process events), `signals` (per-dispatch traffic, very chatty), `globals` (`globalThis` pollution per load phase) — via `debug: { host: true, imports: true }` or `KNITTING_DEBUG=host,imports`. The option and the env var merge; either can enable a namespace. Zero-cost when off: the logger module isn't even imported.",
  "- Payload size: dynamic payloads are hard-capped at ~8 MiB by default (over-cap calls reject with `KNT_ERROR_3`). Raise it with `payload: { maxPayloadBytes, payloadMaxByteLength }` — `maxPayloadBytes` must be `<= payloadMaxByteLength >> 3`; the buffer growth cap defaults to 64 MiB.",
  "- Cancellation & timeouts: `task({ f, timeout: { time: 100 } })` bounds a call, `task({ f, abortSignal: true })` injects an abort toolkit (`signal.hasAborted()`, `signal.now()`) as the task's second argument — it is NOT a DOM `AbortSignal` (no `.aborted`, no `addEventListener`, cannot be passed to `fetch`) — and `worker.hardTimeoutMs` is a hard wall-clock kill for runaway CPU.",
  "- Errors are real: thrown errors and rejected promises return to the host as `Error` objects with `name`, `message`, `stack`, and the full `cause` chain.",
  "",
  "### Browser requirements",
  "",
  '- `knitting/browser` runs the same pool API on web workers. The page must be cross-origin isolated (`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` plus `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`). Every task module must call `setModuleUrl(import.meta.url)` before defining tasks for portable module discovery. Browser workers do not support process workers, compiled/Porffor workers, `BufferReference`, `ProcessSharedBuffer`, or passing a `SharedArrayBuffer` as a task argument. `permission: {...}` is accepted but ignored in the browser; workers retain the privileges of the page.',
  "",
  "### Experimental Andromeda runtime",
  "",
  "- To run Knitting 0.1.74 thread pools on Andromeda 0.1.14, bundle Knitting into one ESM file first. Andromeda can't load npm packages directly, and loading the source files fails with an assertion in Nova's module loader. From the Knitting source checkout, run `bun build knitting.ts --target=browser --outfile=knitting.andromeda.js`, then import the local bundle. Run your app with `andromeda run main.ts`. The [Andromeda guide](/guides/andromeda/) gives the source revision and complete commands.",
  "- Tell Knitting which file you're in by calling `setModuleUrl(import.meta.url)` before `task()` or `importTask()`. Do this in the app entry too, before `createPool()`. Your app, tasks, and helpers can stay in separate files. Task modules, imported task targets, and bootstrap modules can use relative helper imports. If you bundle the whole app, re-export imported pool tasks from the entry so workers can find them among the bundle's exports. Keep host code inside `if (isMain)` and use `try/finally` with `await pool.shutdown()`.",
  "- Andromeda gives each worker its own request lane by default. You can set `host: { steal: true }` to experiment with stealing, but on 0.1.14 the host may only collect results when a one-second fallback timer fires. `KNITTING_STEAL` has no effect because there is no `process.env`.",
  "- Andromeda doesn't support process workers or `ProcessSharedBuffer`. Leave `permission` out when creating the pool: setting it causes pool creation to throw. Andromeda decides what workers can access.",
