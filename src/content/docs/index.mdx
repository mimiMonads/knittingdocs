Knitting is a IPC protocol for Node.js, Deno, and Bun. Define tasks
once, then call them from the main thread with a small, typed API.

    ```ts
    import { isMain, task } from "@vixeny/knitting";

    export const world = task({
      f: (args: string) => args + " world",
    }).createPool({
      threads: 2,
    });

    if (isMain) world.call("hello")
      .then(console.log).finally(world.shutdown);
