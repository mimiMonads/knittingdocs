`createPool(options)(tasks)` starts worker threads and returns helpers:

- `call.<task>(args)` enqueue a task and return a promise.
- `shutdown()` stop all workers.

`call.*()` always returns a promise.
Inputs may also be promises; they are resolved on the host before dispatch.
If an input promise rejects, the host call rejects and the worker task is not
executed. If a task returns a promise, `call.*()` resolves/rejects with the
awaited task result.

See [Promise inputs and awaited outputs](/guides/defining-tasks#promise-inputs-and-awaited-outputs).

:::note
`createPool(...)` can only be called from the main thread. Use `isMain` to guard
entrypoints that create pools.

## Options

```ts
createPool({
  threads?: number,
  payloadInitialBytes?: number,
  payloadMaxBytes?: number,
  inliner?: {
    position?: "first" | "last",
    batchSize?: number,
    dispatchThreshold?: number,
  },
  balancer?: {
    strategy: "robinRound" | "firstIdle" | "randomLane" | "firstIdleOrRandom"
  } | "robinRound" | "firstIdle" | "randomLane" | "firstIdleOrRandom",
  worker?: {
    timers?: {
      spinMicroseconds?: number,
      parkMs?: number,
      pauseNanoseconds?: number,
    },
  },
  host?: {
    stallFreeLoops?: number,
    maxBackoffMs?: number,
  },
  debug?: {
    extras?: boolean,
    logMain?: boolean,
    logHref?: boolean,
    logImportedUrl?: boolean,
  },
})
```

### payloadInitialBytes

Initial size (in bytes) of each payload `SharedArrayBuffer` used by a worker.
Lower values reduce startup memory; the buffer can grow later (when growable
SAB is supported).

### payloadMaxBytes

Maximum size (in bytes) each payload `SharedArrayBuffer` is allowed to grow to.

### Payload buffer behavior

- Defaults:
  - `payloadMaxBytes = 64 * 1024 * 1024` (`64 MiB`)
  - `payloadInitialBytes = 4 * 1024 * 1024` (`4 MiB`) when SAB growth is available
  - If SAB growth is not available, initial size is forced to max size.
- Validation:
  - Non-finite or `<= 0` values are ignored (defaults used).
  - `payloadInitialBytes` is clamped to `payloadMaxBytes`.
- Scope:
  - Applied per worker and per direction (request payload + return payload), so each worker allocates two payload buffers with these limits.

## Example

Basic example:

```ts
import { createPool, isMain, task } from "@vixeny/knitting";

export const add = task<[number, number], number>({
  f: async ([a, b]) => a + b,
});

const { call, shutdown } = createPool({
  threads: 2,
})({ add });

if (isMain) {
  const jobs = [call.add([1, 2]), call.add([3, 4])];
  const results = await Promise.all(jobs);
  console.log(results);
  shutdown();
}
```

:::danger
After `shutdown()` runs, in-flight and future `call.*()` promises reject (reason:
`"Thread closed"`).
:::

## balancer

Controls how calls are routed across lanes (threads, plus the optional inliner).

- `robinRound` (default): round-robin rotation.
- `firstIdle`: pick the first idle lane, else fall back to round-robin.
- `randomLane`: pick a random lane.
- `firstIdleOrRandom`: pick the first idle lane, else random.

## inliner

Adds an extra lane that runs tasks on the main thread.

- `position`: whether the inline lane appears before (`"first"`) or after
  (`"last"`) the worker lanes for balancing purposes.
- `batchSize`: max tasks processed per event-loop tick (default `1` when enabled).
- `dispatchThreshold`: minimum in-flight calls per task invoker before the
  inline lane is eligible (default `1`).
  Below the threshold, only worker lanes are scheduled; at/above it, workers
  plus inline lane are scheduled.
  This option has effect only when `inliner` is enabled.


## worker

### timers

Idle behavior tuning. These affect how workers spin, pause, and park when there
is no work.

#### spinMicroseconds

Busy-spin budget before the worker parks (microseconds). Larger values can
reduce latency under bursty load but increase CPU usage.

Defaults to `max(1, totalLanes) * 35`, where `totalLanes = threads + (inliner ? 1 : 0)`.

#### parkMs

`Atomics.wait` timeout while parked (milliseconds). Smaller values wake more
often (lower latency, higher overhead); larger values sleep longer (lower
overhead, potentially higher latency).

Defaults to `max(1, totalLanes) * 50`.

#### pauseNanoseconds

`Atomics.pause` duration while spinning (nanoseconds). Use this to reduce power
draw / contention during spin loops.

## host

Host dispatcher backoff and scheduling options.

### stallFreeLoops

How many immediate notify loops run before backoff kicks in (default `128`).

### maxBackoffMs

Maximum backoff delay in milliseconds once the dispatcher starts stalling
(default `10`).

## debug

### extras

Enables extra warnings (for example, if `createPool` is accidentally called in a
worker thread).

### logMain

Enables signal logging on the main thread. This writes log files under `./log/`.

### logHref

Logs the worker entry module URL used to spawn workers.
Useful when auditing module resolution (for example `task({ href })` overrides).

### logImportedUrl

Logs the list of module URLs that workers import to discover tasks.
