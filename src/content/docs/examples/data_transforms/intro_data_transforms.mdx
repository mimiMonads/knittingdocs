import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This section groups data-transform examples by workflow stage so you can find
the right pattern quickly.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Validation & parsing">
    Parse incoming strings, validate shape and types, then return safe output.
    Start with [Schema validate](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Schema_validate)
    or [Prompt token budgeting](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Prompt_token_budgeting).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rendering & output">
    Convert validated input into final output formats.
    Try [React SSR](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/React_ssr),
    [React SSR compression](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/React_ssr_compress),
    or [Markdown to HTML](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/Markdown_to_html).
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why this carpet exists

- Validation examples focus on correctness and typed outputs.
- Rendering examples focus on throughput and output size.
- Every example includes a host-only baseline so performance comparisons stay honest.
