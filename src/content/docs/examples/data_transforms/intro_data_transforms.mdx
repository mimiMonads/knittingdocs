This page groups the data-transform examples by workflow stage so you can jump
straight to the pattern you need.

:::info
These examples use payload-carrying workloads on purpose. Primitive-only tasks
are often near-instant, which can hide coordination and transfer costs. Payload
transforms are closer to production traffic, so host-vs-worker comparisons are
more realistic.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Validation & parsing">
    Parse incoming strings, validate shape and types, then return typed output.
    Start with [Schema validation](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Schema_validate),
    [JWT revalidation](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Jwt_revalidation),
    [Salt hashing](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Salt_hashing),
    or [Prompt token budgeting](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Prompt_token_budgeting).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rendering & output">
    Take validated input and produce final output formats.
    Try [Hono server routes](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/Hono_server),
    [React SSR](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/React_ssr),
    [React SSR compression](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/React_ssr_compress),
    or [Markdown to HTML](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/Markdown_to_html).
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why this page exists

- Validation examples focus on correctness and typed output.
- Rendering examples focus on throughput and output size.
- Each example includes a host-only baseline so performance comparisons are apples-to-apples.
