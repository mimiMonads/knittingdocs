Use these examples as practical, copyable patterns for using Knitting in real
workloads: CPU-heavy loops, batch scheduling, and data-transform pipelines.

## Why these examples matter

- They show when parallel work helps (and when it does not).
- They demonstrate safe patterns for batching, pooling, and result aggregation.
- They keep correctness visible with reproducible inputs and validation checks.
- They map to real production tasks, not just toy computations.

## Example map

### Math and simulation

- [Big prime](/examples/maths/Big_prime): long-running BigInt search with
  probabilistic testing.
- [Monte Carlo pi](/examples/maths/Monte_pi): independent sampling and
  reduction.
- [Physics loop](/examples/maths/Physics_loop): branch-heavy simulation with
  per-chunk summaries.
- [TSP (GSA)](/examples/maths/Tsp_gsa): parallel heuristic restarts for NP-hard
  optimization.

### Data transforms

- [Data transforms overview](/examples/data_transforms/intro_data_transforms):
  quick navigation grouped by validation and rendering.
- [Schema validation](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Schema_validate): parse
  JSON strings, validate against a schema, and return typed results.
- [JWT revalidation](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Jwt_revalidation): verify
  JWTs, apply renewal policy, and return stringified token responses.
- [Salt hashing](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Salt_hashing): salt
  passwords, derive PBKDF2 hashes, and verify with constant-time comparison.
- [Prompt token budgeting](/examples/data_transforms/validation/Prompt_token_budgeting):
  shape prompts and trim context before calling an LLM.
- [React SSR](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/React_ssr): parse,
  validate, transform, and render on workers.
- [React SSR compression](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/React_ssr_compress):
  compare where compression should run (worker vs host).
- [Hono server routes](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/Hono_server):
  expose ping, SSR, and JWT endpoints while offloading heavy route work.
- [Markdown to HTML](/examples/data_transforms/rendering_output/Markdown_to_html):
  markdown rendering pipeline with host vs worker comparison.

## What to emulate from these examples

1. Keep worker tasks focused and deterministic.
2. Batch calls and await them together (`Promise.all`) to reduce scheduling overhead.
3. Return compact summaries from workers instead of large raw outputs.
4. Validate invariants on the host and recompute critical metrics when needed.
5. Compare against a host-only baseline before claiming speedups.
6. Tune chunk sizes and thread count based on throughput and stability.

These patterns are meant to keep behavior predictable, debugging straightforward,
and performance scaling easier to reason about.
