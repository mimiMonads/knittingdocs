# BufferReference: ownership-move redesign

Status: ownership and borrow hardening implemented; native backend coverage
still depends on the runtime and available prebuild.

## Current safety status

The original shared-alias and release-order problems are addressed in the
supported transport paths:

- constructing a reference detaches the source buffer;
- producer pins keep the backing store alive until the consumer is finished;
- `release()` detaches every alias before dropping a borrowed producer pin;
- failed detaches use a leak-not-use-after-free fallback;
- pool shutdown revokes outstanding borrows before the worker is terminated;
- forged external payload objects are rejected by the transport identity check.

These guarantees cover normal ownership and lifecycle mistakes. They do not
make `BufferReference` a security boundary. `fromMetadata()` is an unsafe raw
pointer escape hatch: metadata is structurally validated, not authenticated.
Forged same-process metadata, direct native pointer use, and unsynchronized
host/worker mutation remain caller responsibilities and can still crash or
race. Use `ProcessSharedBuffer` for process boundaries and ordinary copied
typed-array payloads when the input is not fully trusted.

The focused ownership tests currently pass on the available backend (32/32).

### Runtime matrix

| Path | Node 22/24 owning addon | Node 26 FFI | Deno/Bun FFI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Forward input | Moved, zero-copy | Moved, zero-copy alias | Moved, zero-copy alias |
| Default returned reference | Co-owned, zero-copy | One safe copy | One safe copy |
| `BufferReferenceReturn: "borrow"` | Revocable borrow | Revocable borrow | Revocable borrow |
| Worker shutdown | Outstanding borrows revoked | Copy while readable, then revoke | Copy while readable, then revoke |

Older Node addons without the owning primitives use the non-owning fallback and
follow the copy/borrow rules rather than the owning-addon column.

## Read and release semantics

An active reference may be read more than once. `toUint8Array()` returns a view
over the moved region; `toArrayBuffer()` returns the moved region as an
`ArrayBuffer`, and may return a sliced copy when the original source was a
subview. Releasing the reference detaches materialized aliases before dropping
the producer pin, so escaped views become empty or throw rather than observing
freed memory.

## Goal

Make `BufferReference` (the `knitting/unsafe` zero-copy buffer handle for
**thread** workers) safe by switching from _shared mutable aliasing_ to an
_ownership move_, while keeping it zero-copy for large payloads (the win is ~1
MiB+ buffers where serializing through the SAB transport costs real time).

The move must work on **all three runtimes** (Node, Deno, Bun). Where an engine
cannot hand cross-isolate ownership to the consumer, the consumer takes a single
copy instead — the protocol is identical, only the materialize primitive
differs.

## What the redesign replaces

1. **Shared mutable aliasing.** The producer's `ArrayBuffer` is _not_ detached
   on send, so producer and consumer alias the same bytes with no
   synchronization.
2. **Raw-pointer lifetime.** The consumer materializes a view over the
   producer's address; if the producer frees/moves it, or the consumer keeps the
   pointer past task settle, it is a use-after-free.

## Core idea

- **`transfer` / detach on construct = nullify the source.** After construction
  only the `BufferReference` owns the bytes; the producer literally cannot touch
  the old handle. This removes the concurrent-aliasing race by language
  semantics, not by convention.
- **Engine-managed backing store.** We keep the backing store alive through the
  engine (a held, transferred `ArrayBuffer` and/or a retained
  `shared_ptr<BackingStore>`), so the GC never collects it mid-flight and we
  avoid hand-rolled SAB/resize logic.
- **Drain-gated release.** The producer releases its hold only once the consumer
  has materialized. On the return path this is detected from the lock's control
  words (XOR == 0 over the whole word = channel quiescent = every reference
  taken).

## The refcount lifeline (the one invariant)

> The producer holds a reference from `produce` until `release`, and the
> consumer takes its **own independent** reference (`adopt`) **before** the
> producer releases. Ordering is enforced by drain (return) or task-settle
> (forward).

As long as this holds, the live reference count never reaches zero while either
side needs the bytes — no UAF, no double free, regardless of timing.

## Physics per engine

| Capability                     | Node (V8 + N-API addon)                                         | Deno (V8 + FFI)                    | Bun (JSC + FFI)         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Read pointer of a view         | addon `getPointer`                                              | `Deno.UnsafePointer.of`            | `Bun.FFI.ptr`           |
| Detach/nullify source          | addon `Detach` / `transferToFixedLength`                        | `transferToFixedLength`            | `transferToFixedLength` |
| Materialize alias (non-owning) | addon `wrapPointer` (NoopDeleter)                               | `UnsafePointerView.getArrayBuffer` | `Bun.FFI.toArrayBuffer` |
| **Owning cross-isolate adopt** | **yes** — `ArrayBuffer::New(isolate, shared_ptr<BackingStore>)` | no                                 | no                      |

Conclusion:

- **Forward path (host → worker input): true zero-copy move on all three.** The
  worker aliases the producer's bytes during the call; the host releases on
  task-settle (after the worker has finished, so it is ordered for free).
- **Return path (worker → host result):** Node 22/24 with the owning addon can
  co-own the backing store; Node 26's FFI path, Deno, and Bun use one safe copy
  by default. The opt-in `borrow` path aliases the producer's bytes and must
  follow the revocation/lifetime rules on every non-owning backend. The host
  detaches aliases before releasing the producer pin and the shutdown barrier
  handles outstanding borrowed returns.

This is the best each engine physically allows for owned returns. Borrowed
returns remain explicit pointer aliases, with revocation before the producer
pin is released; the non-owning FFI backends additionally require careful
lifetime handling around worker shutdown.

## Native capability layer

A single module, `src/connections/buffer-reference-native.ts`, exposes a uniform
interface and hides the per-runtime mechanics:

```ts
type ProducedBuffer = {
  token: bigint; // producer-side release handle
  pointer: bigint; // address of the region start (offset already applied)
  byteLength: number;
};

type BufferReferenceCapabilities = {
  runtime: "node" | "deno" | "bun";
  supportsOwningAdopt: boolean; // consumer keeps bytes after producer release
  produce(view: ArrayBufferView): ProducedBuffer; // detaches source, pins backing
  adopt(
    p: { token: bigint; pointer: bigint; byteLength: number },
    opts?: { copy?: boolean },
  ): ArrayBuffer; // owning (Node) or alias/copy
  release(token: bigint): void; // drop producer hold
};
```

- **Node** routes to addon `retainBackingStore` / `adoptBackingStore` /
  `releaseBackingStore`; `supportsOwningAdopt = true`. Falls back to the legacy
  `retainPointer`/`wrapPointer` (non-owning) if an older prebuild lacks the new
  exports, so the package still loads before a native rebuild.
- **Deno / Bun** route to FFI; the producer pins the transferred `ArrayBuffer`
  in a process-global JS registry keyed by token; `adopt` aliases the pointer
  (and copies when `copy` / retain is required); `supportsOwningAdopt = false`.

## Node addon additions (`src/knitting_buffer_pointer.cc`)

A process-global, mutex-guarded registry of `shared_ptr<v8::BackingStore>` keyed
by token:

- `retainBackingStore(buffer)` → `GetBackingStore()` into the registry,
  `Detach()` the source in the same call, return
  `{ pointer, byteOffset, byteLength, token }`. The backing store survives the
  detach because the registry holds the shared_ptr.
- `adoptBackingStore(token)` → `ArrayBuffer::New(isolate, store)` in the
  caller's isolate (an owning, GC-managed ArrayBuffer that co-owns the store).
  Does not remove the entry.
- `releaseBackingStore(token)` → drop the registry's shared_ptr ref.

Legacy
`getPointer`/`retainPointer`/`releasePointer`/`wrapPointer`/`detachArrayBuffer`
stay for the fallback path. Requires `bun run build:native` on a Node toolchain
and refreshed `prebuilds/`.

## Transport integration

### Forward (host → worker)

- `new BufferReference(view)` calls `produce(view)` → source detached, backing
  pinned, metadata carries `{ pointer, byteLength, token, origin, runtime }`.
- Worker decode builds a `BufferReference` from metadata; `toArrayBuffer()`
  calls `adopt` (owning on Node, alias on Deno/Bun — the worker uses it during
  the call, so an alias is safe).
- Host releases its hold on **task settle** via the existing finalizer wiring
  (`attachPayloadTransportFinalizer` + `runTaskFinalizers`, added in `43ee3e7`).

### Return (worker → host) — as implemented

- The worker function returns a `BufferReference`; it is encoded as a dedicated
  raw-word `BufferReference` static payload on the return lock (same finalizer
  attachment as the forward leg, but no JSON metadata encode/decode).
- **Host claims eagerly in the codec `decode`**, gated by
  `RUNTIME_IS_MAIN_THREAD` (host = return; worker thread = forward = lazy
  alias). This runs inside `resolveHost` _before_ it flips `workerBits`.
  Owning/copy modes take the bytes right there; borrow mode only records the
  claim and adopts on first read (see “Borrow hardening” below), which is safe
  because the explicit release protocol keeps the worker pin held either way.
- Safe Deno/Bun returns copy during decode. Opt-in borrowed Deno/Bun returns
  alias the pointer during decode, keep the worker producer hold in an
  explicit-release map, and release it when `BufferReference.release()` /
  `[Symbol.dispose]()` / the host GC finalizer posts a token-release message
  back to that worker.
- Otherwise, the worker keeps the return payload's producer-release in a
  **pending-release queue** in `rx-queue.ts` (`sendReturn` captures
  `slot.finalize` before the slot recycles) instead of releasing on settle.
- The worker `loop` (`src/worker/loop.ts`) calls `drainReturnReleases()` each
  iteration: it reads the **return lock's two control words** atomically
  (`returnLock.hostBits`/`workerBits`, not the cached shadows) and, when the
  channel is quiescent (`(hostBits ^ workerBits) === 0`), releases every queued
  token. Global quiescence sidesteps per-bit ABA: at all-agree, every published
  return has been acked. Early-outs on an empty queue, so non-BufferReference
  workloads pay only a length check.

## API / metadata changes

- `BufferReferenceMetadata` gains `token: string`.
- `toArrayBuffer()` / `toUint8Array()` semantics: returns an **owned** buffer on
  Node; on Deno/Bun returns an alias for in-call/borrowed use and a copy when
  retained past release in the safe default mode.
- `release()` / `[Symbol.dispose]()` explicitly drops borrowed returned
  references and tells the producing worker it can release its pinned backing
  store.
- Producing detaches the source: reading the original view after construction
  throws (it is the move). Documented as the contract.
- Process-worker use still throws (raw pointers are process-local) — unchanged.

## Tests

- Rework `test/buffer-reference.test.ts` for move semantics: source is detached
  after construct; consumer sees the same bytes; host result survives worker
  release (the refcount proof); offset/length views; zero-length guard;
  process-worker rejection.
- New `test/buffer-reference-native.test.ts`: `produce → adopt → release`
  round-trip + source-detach + copy-mode, runnable on Deno and Bun (FFI paths).
- 1 MiB round-trip both directions through a real pool.

## Milestones

1. **Foundation — DONE.** Node C++ owning primitives,
   `buffer-reference-native.ts` capability layer (Deno + Bun FFI, Node addon w/
   fallback), addon type update, `buffer-reference-native.test.ts`.
2. **BufferReference refactor — DONE.** `produce/adopt/release` routed through
   the layer; detach-on-construct (the move); metadata gained `token` +
   `byteOffset`; producer GC backstop via `FinalizationRegistry`;
   `buffer-reference.test.ts` rewritten for move semantics. Full Deno suite
   (248)
   - Bun green.
3. **Return path — DONE.** Worker returns an explicit `BufferReference` (encoded
   as the existing external payload on the return lock). The host claims
   ownership **eagerly in the codec decode**, gated by `RUNTIME_IS_MAIN_THREAD`
   (host = return = eager owning/copy; worker thread = forward = lazy alias) —
   no lock.ts hot-path hook, no per-call closure. The worker defers the return
   payload's producer-release into a pending queue in `rx-queue.ts` and drains
   it from the worker `loop` when the return lock is quiescent
   (`returnLock.hostBits ^ returnLock.workerBits == 0`). Fixtures
   `returnsBuffer`
   - `echoBufferPlusOne`; full Deno suite (250) + Bun green.
4. **Hardening — mostly DONE.** README + `ref.ts` rewritten to the move contract
   (both verified runnable on Deno + Bun); `bench/buffer-reference.ts` added
   (BufferReference round trip vs Uint8Array transport). Shutdown-drain is
   **deferred by design** — see open risks. Node build/bench pending a Node
   toolchain.

The borrowed return path removes the Deno/Bun returned-payload copy. The round
trip still grows with buffer size because this benchmark's task body allocates
an output buffer and copies bytes into it (`out.set(src)`). A no-work identity
task would isolate pointer-move overhead more directly, but it would also need a
separate ownership protocol for returning the same host-produced buffer.

## Borrow hardening: revocation instead of lifetime (2026-07)

Non-owning engines cannot keep a foreign isolate's backing store alive, so the
borrowed return path enforces the dual invariant instead: **no reachable view
may ever observe freed memory.** Two proofs are used, and every path to dropping
a pin is preceded by one of them:

1. **Revocation.** `release()` detaches every alias buffer the reference handed
   out (`detachArrayBufferBestEffort`) _before_ the worker pin drops. Detaching
   neutralizes all views (they read as empty / throw); it is free
   (`transferToFixedLength(0)` on FFI aliases, addon `Detach` on Node) and
   verified by a CI canary in `buffer-reference-native.test.ts`.
2. **Proof of deadness.** Before the first read no view can exist, so the
   borrow's `FinalizationRegistry` backstop watches the `BufferReference`
   itself; the first materialize migrates it onto the **alias ArrayBuffer**.
   Views strongly reference their buffer, so the GC-driven release can only fire
   once no view can reach the bytes — a ref dropped while a view escapes no
   longer unpins. The adopt stays lazy on purpose: FFI aliases charge their
   byteLength to the consumer's GC, so an eager adopt made every borrowed return
   pay a size-scaled GC-accounting cost even when never read (measured ~4x on
   Bun 4 MiB returns).

The fallback rule is **leak-not-UAF**: if a detach fails, `release()` does not
send the token release; the backstop stays registered and retries once the
buffers are truly unreachable. The producer backstop uses the same idea as a
shared countdown over the reference plus every materialized alias buffer.

**Shutdown barrier.** Each lane tracks outstanding borrowed returns in a
`Map<token, WeakRef<BufferReference>>` (fed by the `track` hook of
`BufferReferenceReturnHooks`). Before a worker dies, `markWorkerClosed` revokes
them via `revokeBorrow`: on graceful shutdown/kill the bytes are copied first,
so held references stay readable while stale views go empty; on crash/exit the
aliases are detached only, so reads fail loud instead of aliasing freed memory.

## First-class SharedArrayBuffer transport

Separate feature, built on the same capability layer (`produceShared` /
`adoptShared` / `releaseShared`) but otherwise independent of `BufferReference`
— a SAB is native to JS and is passed as a plain task argument/return:

```ts
const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1 << 20);
await pool.call.initWorker(sab); // shared by reference, zero copy
```

- **Pointer alias, every runtime** (the chosen design — `postMessage` is an
  anti-goal; knitting replaces it). The encoder detects a `SharedArrayBuffer`
  ([payloadCodec.ts](../src/memory/payloadCodec.ts) dispatch) and ships it as an
  external payload carrying `{ pointer, token, byteLength }`; the consumer
  materializes a **non-owning `ArrayBuffer` alias** over the same physical bytes
  via `getPointer` + `wrapPointer` (Node) / FFI (Deno/Bun). Cross-thread writes
  are visible both ways (same memory); it is thread-workers-only (process
  workers reject it on the origin check).
- **No native registry, GC-managed pin.** The producer pins the SAB in a JS
  `WeakMap` keyed by the SAB itself (share-once), released by a
  `FinalizationRegistry` when the SAB is collected — so the pin tracks the
  producer's SAB lifetime, with no settle/drain coupling. See
  [shared-array-buffer-payload.ts](../src/connections/shared-array-buffer-payload.ts).

### Lesson: why NOT a real cross-isolate SAB

The first attempt reconstructed a real `SharedArrayBuffer` in the worker via
`v8::SharedArrayBuffer::New(isolate, store)` (cross-thread Atomics worked). It
**segfaulted on teardown**: a worker isolate co-owning the shared backing store,
then terminated by `terminateWorkerQuietly`, corrupts the store. A second cause
was holding the SAB's `shared_ptr<BackingStore>` in the **static** C++ registry
— GC-released, so it often outlived V8 and the static map's destructor freed it
after shutdown. Both are avoided by the pointer-alias + JS-Map-pin design above;
the `SharedArrayBuffer::New` path was removed from the addon entirely.

## Open risks

- Node owning path is untestable in this sandbox (no Node toolchain); validate
  on CI after `build:native`.
- Sustained return traffic defers reclamation until the channel next quiesces;
  the pending-release queue holds pinned buffers until then (bounded by memory;
  backpressure is otherwise desirable). Consider a high-water fallback later.
- The shutdown barrier handles outstanding borrowed returns: it
  copy-then-detaches while the worker is readable, and detaches without a copy
  after a crash, before the worker terminates.
- `GetBackingStore()` / `ArrayBuffer::New(isolate, store)` are stable V8 APIs
  since 7.9; confirm no deprecation noise on the Node 22 ABI used by
  `prebuilds/`.
- **Shutdown-drain is deferred.** Pool teardown is an abrupt
  `terminateWorkerQuietly` with no graceful worker-side hook, so a clean
  in-worker drain is not wireable against a hard terminate. In the steady state
  this is a non-issue: the worker `loop` drains the pending-release queue every
  time the return lock quiesces, so by the time a pool is idle/shut down the
  queue is normally empty. The only leak is a worker terminated **mid-flight**
  with un-acked returns: on Deno/Bun the producer holds are freed with the
  isolate; on Node the process-global `shared_ptr<BackingStore>` entries persist
  until process exit. A future signal/exit handler can flush them.
